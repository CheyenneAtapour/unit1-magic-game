Magic Duels is a miniature version of the card game Magic: The Gathering.
All cards are from the Alpha Edition!


The game: Using mana, unleash the power of your creature cards to lower your opponent's life total
to 0. Basic rules of play apply: you may play one land and draw one land per turn, creatures have
summoning sickness.

Some caveats: In this current stage of development, player 2 will attack (if able) with a random creature and a blocker will be assigned at random. (this is one major area of gameplay to be improved upon)
  You may assign attacking creatures individually.
